<p>The Intro to Coding Challenge with Code First Girls is a 4-week challenge aiming to get participants to create Flowcharts and PseudoCode to represent the problems presented. 

We were sorted into teams and presented with 5 coding problems. There were be 3 core problems and 2 additional problems. Teams were required to submit responses to 2 out of 5 questions for this challenge of our choosing in the form of a presentation. The top 3 submissions were invited to present on 24th October 2023.</p>

Feel free to send us feedback on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gitpointapp) or [file an issue](https://github.com/gitpoint/git-point/issues/new). Feature requests are always welcome. If you wish to contribute, please take a quick look at the [guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md)!

If there's anything you'd like to chat about, please feel free to join our [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/git-point)!

## Design (Phase One)

This project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors) specification and is brought to you by these [awesome contributors](./CONTRIBUTORS.md).


## Design (Phase Two)

This project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors) specification and is brought to you by these [awesome contributors](./CONTRIBUTORS.md).


## Build Process

- Follow the [React Native Guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for getting started building a project with native code. **A Mac is required if you wish to develop for iOS.**
- Clone or download the repo
- `yarn` to install dependencies
- `yarn run link` to link react-native dependencies
- `yarn start:ios` to start the packager and run the app in the iOS simulator (`yarn start:ios:logger` will boot the application with [redux-logger](<https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger>))
- `yarn start:android` to start the packager and run the app in the the Android device/emulator (`yarn start:android:logger` will boot the application with [redux-logger](https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger))

Please take a look at the [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for a detailed process on how to build your application as well as troubleshooting information.

**Development Keys**: The `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` in `api/index.js` are for development purposes and do not represent the actual application keys. Feel free to use them or use a new set of keys by creating an [OAuth application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) of your own. Set the "Authorization callback URL" to `gitpoint://welcome`.
